        <p>Square for Restaurants is a point of sale system created to serve the specific needs of the hectic restaurant world.</p> 
        <p>After observing busy chefs, servers, and managers, who showed us archaic restaurant software that was incredibly feature rich but very complex to operate, we decided to build a reliable, self-serving point of sale system that let restaurant employees spend less time on technology and more time on what matters: providing tasty food and great service.</p>
