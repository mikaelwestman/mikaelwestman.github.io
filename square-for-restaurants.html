          <p>Square for Restaurants is a point of sale system (the thing restaurant staff use to enter your order and take payments with). It's specifically created to serve the needs of the hectic restaurant world.</p> 
          <p>After observing busy chefs, servers, and managers who showed us archaic restaurant software that was incredibly feature rich but very complex to operate, we built a reliable, self-serving point of sale system that let restaurant employees spend less time on technology and more time on what matters: providing tasty food and great service.</p>

        <p class="image-description">A glaring screen can ruin the vibe even in the coziest of bars so we created a dark mode that won't blind neither servers nor guests.</p>

        <p class="image-description">Observe a server entering your order at a restaurant and you'll notice that muscle memory is everything: experienced servers barely look at the screen while entering orders. To support this workflow we created generous tap targets and speedy transitions because for restaurants <b>speed is a feature</b>.</p>

        <p class="image-description">The lock screens give employees a quick glance of important information and action items, like menu items that the restaurant have run out of or delivery orders that needs to be accepted (from integrations with Postmates and other delivery services).</p>
