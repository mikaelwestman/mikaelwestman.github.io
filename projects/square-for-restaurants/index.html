    <h1>Square for Restaurants</h1>
    <p class="hover_img">Square is known for their little white credit card reader, traditionally used at small independent businesses. Since its inception in 2009, the company and its community of sellers has grown exponentially.</p>

    <p>Square Point of Sale, the original app for sellers using Square works great for smaller businesses. But for bigger or more speicalized sellers, the app falls short. After all, a busy restaurant in New York has very different needs than a hair salon in rural Montana. To solve this, Square set out to build multiple vertical specific solutions.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale/restaurants" target="_blank">Restaurants</a> is one of these verticals (the others being <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale/retail" target="_blank">Retail</a> and <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/solutions/professional-services" target="_blank">Professional Services</a>). We began work in 2016: a tiny team visting restaurants, talking to busy chefs, servers, and managers—who showed us archaic restaurant software that was incredibly feature rich but way more complex & expensive than need be.</p>

      <p>Archaic restaurant software/hardware and a food delivery "tablet farm".</p>
    </div>

    <p>A restaurant point of sale needs to be fast and reliable to let service run smoothly: increasing the customer turn rate and revenue.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, orders are often placed from outside the restaurant, via food delivery services such as Grubhub or Uber Eats. Each food delivery service provide restaurants with a tablet for managing orders, resulting in a multitude of food delivery tablets cluttering the counter. Not only are these “tablet farms” ugly, but highly ineffective, as the tablets don't talk to the point of sale. Meaning that a server accepting an online order from a food delivery tablet also has to input said order on the point of sale so that the kitchen can start making the order and the sale is tracked in reporting.</p>

    <p>We removed this duplicative work by integrating food delivery services with the point of sale, allowing servers to manage in-house and outside orders on the the same device. This is only one example of how we modernized the restaurant point of sale. Our worked touched everything from onboarding and setup, to order taking, reporting, and employee payrolls.</p>

    <p>In 2018 we finally launched Square for Restaurants. A reliable, self-serving point of sale solution that let restaurant employees spend less time on technology and more time on what matters: tasty food and great service.</p>

  <div class="image-block"><img src="../../images/square-mikael-westman-01.png"><p>Servers use the item grid to input customer orders that are printed to the kitchen. Muscle memory is everything: experienced servers barely look at the screen while entering orders. To support this workflow we created generous tap targets and speedy transitions.</p></div>

  <div class="image-block"><img src="../../images/square-mikael-westman-02.png"><p>"Medium rare, no onions, add mustard". Item modifications takes time to enter and slows down service. We optimized the item modification flow for as few interactions as possible, automatically stepping servers through options (temperature, toppings, etc) until all requirements are fulfilled.</p></div>

Plenty of time was spent on updating the outdated Square Dashboard framework that looked more like an org chart than navigation for managing day-to-day restaurant tasks.</p></div>
