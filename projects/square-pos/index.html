    <h1>Square Point of Sale</h1>
    <p>Square Point of Sale is the app that made credit card processing available to anyone with a smartphone. Today it has grown into a fully featured point of sale system with an ever growing feature list. Historically being an iOS based app we spent large parts of 2015 improving our Android app, introducing a new visual language and bringing it to feature parity with iOS. As sellers might switch between operating systems we wanted to keep the Square experience consistent across devices, while still adhering to Android guidelines where suitable.</p>
